# Squid-Fusion

## Revamped Collections

### Simultaneous Aggregates

To allow for maximal performance,
Squid collections are fundamentally on-demand â€“ computation does not happen until a folding operation is ran.
To make it clear where and when actual traversals happen, methods such as `count`, `sum` and `fold` return an aggregate `Aggr[T]` instead of just `T`, on which `run` must be called to get the result of type `T`.

Another advantage is that different aggregates can be composed together modularly



#### Example

What options does one have to aggregate different things in the current standard collections?
<!--Say one wants to aggregate all negative and all positive elements of a list into two new lists.-->

Say one wants to aggregate all `Left` and `Right` elements of a `List[Either[A,B]]` into two new lists.

In specific cases such as this one, there may exist a function that does what we want, such as `partition`.
But `partition` is boolean-blind. `ls.partition(_.isLeft)` returns two `List[Either[A,B]]` instead of `List[Left[A,Nothing]]` and `List[Right[Nothing,B]]` or even `List[A]` and `List[B]`. It is unfortunately not possible to `collect` both lists _during their construction_ so that does not happen.

Moreover, say one now wants to also know the sizes to these lists.
In Scala, `list.size` is linear, so it's a pity to call `.size` _after_ we have just traversed the two lists!

use fold:
reimplement all the aggregates _and_ pay for ridiculous boxing!
use an imperative loop: at least don't pay for boxing, but also reimplement the folds.

_**In Squid-Fusion, one simply writes:**_

```scala
def splitLeftRight[A,B](ls: List[Either[A,B]]): (List[A],List[B],Int) = {
  val p = ls.toProducer
  val traversal = for {
    n  <- p.count
    as <- p collect { case Left(a)  => a } toList
    bs <- p collect { case Right(b) => b } toList
  } yield (as,bs,n)
  traversal.run
}
```

TODO show perf improvement vs other approahces; + perfs after `optimize`

Naturally, better to stay with SF constructs than going back and forth with ScalaCol constructs.




### Generalized Splitting, a.k.a _Repeating_

Word count per sentence

```
(p: Producer[String]) =>
  p.repeat( _.asProducer.takeUntil('.')
                        .repeat(_.takeUntil(' '))
                        .filter(_.nonEmpty.run)
                        .count.run ) : Producer[Int]
```

Pair by 3, dropping first one: `p.repeat(_ take 3 drop 1)`
